##### Building

All of the build scripts are run through `npm`. Here are some common tasks:

`npm run build` - Rebuild the project into the `out` folder.
`npm run watch` - Rebuild the project and watch for changes.
`npm run serve` - Start a BrowserSync server, serving the `out` folder.
`npm run prod`  - Rebuild the project for production; this will take a little extra time.
`npm run gae`   - Rebuild the project for production and copy the `out` folder to `gae/static` to prep for deployment.
