# CornerStone ES6 - a simple project seed with ES6

## Getting Started

If you don't have Node.js already,

* [Node](https://nodejs.org/)

To install local project dependencies, run:

  `npm install`

All of the build scripts are run through `npm`. Here are some common tasks:

`npm run build` - Rebuild the project into the `out` folder.

`npm run watch` - Rebuild the project and watch for changes.

`npm run serve` - Start a BrowserSync server, serving the `out` folder.

`npm run prod`  - Rebuild the project for production; this will take a little extra time.

`npm run gae`   - Rebuild the project for production and copy the `out` folder to `gae/static` to prep for deployment.

run `npm run watch`, then `npm run serve` in another window/tab for development
